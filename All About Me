-  Hi, I’m RobloxLover745!
-  I’m interested in making projects on Scratch, and doing Roblox with my friends!
-  My username on Scratch is RobloxGamerGirl13, and my username on Roblox is Supercatlulu13!
-  I want to change the internet repntoverse by being a great digital citizen and solving bully problems positively, which I've done multipule times.
-  My favorite animal is a cat, and I have a cat named Gigi! Gigi's name is pronounced "Giggy" and she's female.
-  I also love, love, love, to make friends! I have thirty-something true friends on Roblox and on Scratch, I have nine!
-  And, guess what?
-  One time, I met someone who joined way before me on Roblox, and they had never finished a five hundred and fifty stage obby like I have!
- And the funny thing is, that I finished the obby when I was NEW to Roblox! Well guys, bye! And have a splendid day!
